# pysay

Like `cowsay` but with a `python` and written in `Python`.

From a `Real Python` tutorial.

It's a simple project that let's me focus on other things like CI, Releases,
Publishing, Pages, etc.

Once it's feature complete, I might treat it as an archived project and only
play with dependency update related maintenance.

## Development environment

Using [devbox](https://github.com/jetify-com/devbox) to manage the development
environment.

### devbox

Before starting development, run `devbox shell` to enter the devbox development
environment.

To see the list of available "scripts" run:

```bash
devbox run --list
```

To start a devbox shell run:

```bash
devbox shell
```

To run an individual command in a devbox shell run:

```bash
devbox update_locks
```
