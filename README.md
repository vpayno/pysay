# pysay

Like `cowsay` but with a `python` and written in `Python`.

From a `Real Python` tutorial.

It's a simple project that let's me focus on other things like CI, Releases, Publishing, Pages, etc.

Once it's feature complete, I might treat it as an archived project and only play with dependency update related maintenance.
